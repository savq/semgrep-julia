      Update declarations and assignments (#78)
      
      * Update declarations and assignments
      
      - Add local and global declarations.
      - Split `assignment_expression` into two rules:
        - `assignment`
        - `compound_assignment_expression`
      - Fix `assignment` allowing arbitrary expressions in the LHS.
      - Rename `bare_tuple_expression` to `bare_tuple`.
      - Add a separate rule for let bindings (these don't allow bare tuples).
      - Update tests

      Update type operators, quotations and other minor fixes (#87)
      
      * Type operators
      - Rename `subtype_clause` to `type_clause`:
        - Remove subtype operator from `typed_expression`.
        - Add supertype operator to `type_clause`.
        - Note that outside definitions, both `<:` and `>:` are parsed as comparison
          operators.
      - Add `where_expression`: The rule `where_clause` is still needed because
        `where` has a different precedence depending on whether it's in a type
        parameter or if it's a regular expression.
      
      * Quotes
      - Add assignment operators to quote_expression.
      - Change precedence of colon `:` as identifier.
      - Parse `primitive type` and `abstract type` as a single token. This enables
        parsing `primitive` and `abstract` as identifiers.
      - Add a list of keywords: This enables quoting some keywords without
        tree-sitter trying to parse their corresponding rule. This can still fail
        depending on the context, but in most cases it's good enough.
      
      * Misc
      - Add typed parameters to `function_expression`.
      - Add closed macros to `keyword_parameters` (they're already allowed in regular
        parameters).
      - Add assignments to `ternary_expression`.
      - Remove `generator_expression` and allow a trailing `_comprehension_clause` in
        any collection.
      - Fix arrow, prefix and postfix precedences.
      - Fix pipes names.
